# Global Agent Instructions

- Always add descriptive comments for any new blocks of code that you create and organize shared utilities for reuse.
- Maintain a polished, modern UI with smooth animations, balanced spacing, and consistent alignment across any visual changes.
- Avoid running automated tests for small tweaks; reserve them for substantial changes that warrant regression coverage.
- Double-check for syntax errors before finalizing updates and ensure existing functionality remains intact.
